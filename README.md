# Lusternia-Scripts
Just where I'm dumping all of my scripts that I put together, as I find a need.

For Seasonal Descriptions - change the words desc1, 2, 3, and 4 to what your actual descriptions are. It should look like ("and this is a description", "and this is another") etc. This will use the first set of quotation marks as your Spring description, then Summer, Fall, and Winter respectively.

For the expanded Design List trigger, it will use a gated trigger such that when you check "Design List <cartel>", it will tally up all Submitted, Recall, Reject, and WIP designs and give you the totals alongside the Total designs in the Cartel.

Tarpits Dancing - This automates the difficult task of dancing with Lossam and Cidinnanc. If any commands are missing, be sure to message Essoheli the full line and what move needs to be done.
